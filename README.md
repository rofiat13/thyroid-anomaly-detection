# Thyroid Anomaly Detection using XGBoost

This project aims to detect anomalies in thyroid data using the XGBoost algorithm.

## Usage

Install the required libraries:
numpy,
pandas,
matplotlib,
seaborn, 
scikit-learn, 
xgboost.


## Dataset
The dataset contains thyroid data with labeled outliers.

## Model Training and Evaluation
The data is split into training and test sets, and an XGBoost classifier is trained using grid search for hyperparameter tuning. The model is evaluated using accuracy score and classification report.

## Visualization
A ROC curve is plotted to visualize the performance of the model.
